------------------ REPOSITORY:
- This is a RIGID contract to follow for a particular feature.
- here, we declare the blue_prints of FUNCTIONS which will laber be CALLED by usecases.
- By doing so, we will be very strict to follow the contract--we should have same return_type & same params_type.
- This way, there will be no room for errors.




------------------ USECASES:

- usecases DEPEND on repository (Auth_Repo), so, it needs the _repo_instance to call each function.
- usecases are there ONLY_TO_CCCAAALLL those functions of it's Repo. (Auth_Repo)
- Every usecase is responsible for ONLY-1 functionality execution which facilitates Single_Resposibility_Principle(S)
- This way, every function is independent from another.
- every usecase ðŸ’¯ follows the same blue_print of REPOSITORY. (tho, it just calls the function, it MUST have the same fun skeleton as that of its REPO)




------------------ REMOTE DATA SOURCES:

- here, we DONOT return Either<Failure, Data> but, we directly THROW the error.
- then, this error is further catched in Repositoy Layer!

- we reference the USER_MODEL instead of USER in Data layer.
- in DOMAIN & PRESENTATION layers, we always always alwaaaays reference USER instead of USER_MODEL




------------------ DEPENDENCY INJECTION

- Here, whenever there is a dependency of one over the other, i.e. when one is dependent over the other, we should never try to PASS them through the constructors. 
- We take the help of get_it to INJECT them over! and we access them whenever & wherever needed! This will be automatically handled by get_it.
- Get_it finds the exact needed instance for you.
